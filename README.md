# Simple image classifier with JAX and Elegy


## Introduction to JAX

## What will you find here?

This is a simple example on how to build a image classifier based on JAX and Elegy.\
I am using transfer learning through bottleneck features, which gives me the ability to use any architecture as a feature extractor and build the upper layers with JAX.\
Some of the more famous architecture, are not yet implemented in JAX, so this is an example on how to use a Keras/Tensorflow feature extractor and use it to feed JAX model.
